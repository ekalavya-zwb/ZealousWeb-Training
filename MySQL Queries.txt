Day 1: MySQL Fundamentals:-

Exercise 1.1: Create a database called company_db:
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
SHOW DATABASES;

Exercise 1.2: Create a table named employees: 
USE company_db;
CREATE TABLE employees(
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50),
email VARCHAR(100),
hire_date DATE,
salary DECIMAL
);
SELECT * FROM employees;

Exercise 1.3: Create another table departments: 
CREATE TABLE departments(
dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
dept_name VARCHAR(50),
location VARCHAR(50)
);
SELECT * FROM departments;

Day 2: MySQL - Data Manipulation & Queries:-

Exercise 2.1: Insert 4 employees into the employees table with different salaries and hire dates:
INSERT INTO employees(id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary) VALUES (100, "Ekalavya", "Patel", "ekalavya@gmail.com", "2026-01-01", 15000);
INSERT INTO employees(first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary) VALUES ("Shubham", "Patel", "shubham@gmail.com", "2026-01-01", 16000);
INSERT INTO employees(first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary) VALUES ("Divya", "Gupta", "divya@gmail.com", "2026-01-01", 15000);
INSERT INTO employees(first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary) VALUES ("Utkarsh", "Sharma", "utkarsh@gmail.com", "2026-01-01", 14000);

Exercise 2.2: Insert 4 departments into the departments table:
INSERT INTO departments(dept_id, dept_name, location) VALUES (200, "Development", "302");
INSERT INTO departments(dept_name, location) VALUES ("Testing", "301");
INSERT INTO departments(dept_name, location) VALUES ("Development", "302");
INSERT INTO departments(dept_name, location) VALUES ("Designing", "202");
SELECT * FROM departments;

Exercise 2.3: Write queries to:
i).Select all employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

ii).Select only first_name and email of all employees
SELECT first_name, email FROM employees;

iii).Find employees with salary > 50000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

iv).Find employees hired after '2023-01-01'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date > "2023-01-01";

v).Count total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmplCount FROM employees;

Exercise 2.4: Update exercises:
i).Increase salary by 10% for a specific employee
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + (salary * 0.1) WHERE id = 103;

ii).Change department location for a specific department
UPDATE departments SET location = "201" WHERE dept_id = 203;

Exercise 2.5: Advanced queries:
i).Find the highest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) AS HighSal FROM employees;

ii).Find average salary of all employees
SELECT AVG(salary) AS AvgSal FROM employees;(Doubt)

iii).List employees ordered by salary (highest first)
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

iv).Find employees whose first name starts with 'J'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE "J%";

v).Get the 3 most recently hired employees
(Doubt)

Exercise 2.6: Delete an employee record and verify deletion:
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 100;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 100;
